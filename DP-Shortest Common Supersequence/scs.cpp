         concept used
         eg. brute groot
         we standing at last position 5 since shifting of index done we check if the current char is same if yes we take the char once , if the char's are not equal then we compare which is larger the comparision done between (pos1-1,pos2) and (pos1,pos2-1) element in dp suppose (pos1-1,pos2 ) element is bigger we have to move at that position which states the left dp element (visualize in the dp table) which was smaller will be left out of comparision since the part left for comparision will be text1[pos1-1-1](since we have done shifiting of index and if standing at position pos1-1 then element in text will be equivalent pos1-1-1) and in text2[pos2] hence we take the text1[pos1-1] element similarly if we move left then oppsite element is taken into consideration.
