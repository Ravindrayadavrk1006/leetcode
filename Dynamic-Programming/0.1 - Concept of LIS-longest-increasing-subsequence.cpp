PROBLEM-> find the length of largest increasing subsequence
    /*
        LIS is very important concept for finding the LONGEST SUBSEQUENCE
        the condition of IF inside the nested O(n^2) for loop will say what  we are finding, hence whenver we are asked about longest subsequence always try to go for LIS

        eg . if we want to find the longest increasing subsequence then we need to put in the IF condition if(arr[j]< arr[i]) , if decreasing then arr[j]> arr[i] and son.
