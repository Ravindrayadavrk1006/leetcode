/*
    here two conditions are very important:
    tlow[it]>=tin[node]
        it is saying that adjencent child cannot reach to a node that was dfs traversed before THE node,
        which means there is no way that a child can be reached to any node above THE node whose adjecent is this child node
        which means THE node is articulation , i.e if we remove THE node then the graph would break into two parts
    first_node_child_counter > 1 && parent == -1
        we are separately handling root node since it will mess up things
    
    
    if the adjnode is already visited :
        tlow[node] = min(tlow[node],tin[it]); there is this another change from the briges finding question using tarzans algorithm ,that we are not using tlow of adjenct node
         below to reach other node we will have to go throught the adjcent node hence using tin instead of tlow
  
  
  ****refer to CP NOTES for some clearity
