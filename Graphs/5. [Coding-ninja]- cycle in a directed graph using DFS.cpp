/*
  here it is same as undirected but with one difference that we are keeping a local path_visit arra for marking the nodes visited int the current path.
  reason for it since a node can be viisted in other path but it's not necessary that we can reach to that node in current path. so to overcome this we are keeping a path_visit to only track if visited in the current path
  also we are keeping a normal visit array so that we don't visit already visited node normally
