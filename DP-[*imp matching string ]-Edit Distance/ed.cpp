//using the concept of string matching 
# Approach
in depth approach explained inside the code 
using the concept of matching strings solved
if current char matched then we look for remaining chars in the current_word1_index -1 length word1 and the current char doesn't match
then we have three posibilities 
1. we can remove the current element and keep looking for the word2 in remaining word1 
2. we can insert a similar element to the one which we are finding and can look for remaining element in the remaining string
3. we can replace the current unmatched element with the current required element of word2 
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n*m)

- Space complexity:
O(n*m + n+m(stack space))
