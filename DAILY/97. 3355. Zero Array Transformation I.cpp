        using line sweep algorithm->


            line sweep algorithm ->  we are taking each query which is a range ->
            we are inserting the query[0], +1  -> +1 denotes it's the starting of the query, we are inserting query[1] + 1 , -1  -> -1 denoting it's a end of a query  ,  also +1 is being done because according to the question till current element it will be considered but not from next element because according to the question [1,3] represent the line is from 1 till 3 after 3 the line won't be there and since the point are integer hence query[1]+1   therefore that (+1) is done.



            once we have inserting, we do the sorting (normal line sweep)

            then we take a element called current which will calcuate the current value
            and we travese the elements of line_sweep sorted vector
            we keep on updating the current vector and also marking in a vector called range_substraction the boundary value i.e pair.first with the current value

            range_substraction vector is saying that where till non-zero next value current value will be considered

            eg [2,0,0, 4, 0,0, 1]  -> from index 0 to 2  -> 2 value will be considered , from index 3 to 5 -> 4 value will be considered and on 6 -> 1 value will be considered.

            we are filling same thing i.e above vector making it [2,2,2,4,4,4,1] in the next for loopp i.e STEP 4


            in the STEP 5 we are substracting from the nums array and if at any point we find the value after substraction is greater than 0 then we return false else return true;
