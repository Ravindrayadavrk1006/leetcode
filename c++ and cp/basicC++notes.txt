data types=>
char => a single char represented by '' whereas string by ""
internally for char ascii value is stored ,
int,
double=2.5
bool d=true  //will print 1 any number apart from 0 is true
long int,long long int or long or long long respectively
ascii  values=> 48 =>0,65=>A, 97=>a

* for taking input doesn't matter if we input using any number of space or 
by doing on a new line 

**important
7/2 =>3 since both are integers the ouptut will be interger
7.0/2 => will give 3.5 
the value will be ouput in form of higher of the datatypes used
precedence higher to lower=> double,float,long long int,long int,int char

**calculation is done in the highest precedence type present in the expression   

=============
EPISODE -2

calculation precedence=> double >float> long long >long int>int >char



OVERFLOW=>

int range=> 2^-30 to 2^-30 i.e 10^-9 to 10^9
long int =>10^-12 to 10^12
long long int=> 10^-18 to 10^18

int maximum=INT_MAX //for getting maximum int value

int a=100000
int b=100000
long int c=a*b 
will give wrong value in c since a,b are int values and hence the calculation takes place in
the highest precedence type i.e int and hence will give int value which we are trying to store in 
in a long . A int value we are trying to store in long which will give wrong value

for correct => long int c= a*1LL*b  //we put something which will take the entire solution in 
double a
double b
double c=a*b
cout<<fixed<<setprecision(0)<<c  //for getting output in normal form instead of scientific base e form 
//setprecision for no points value
